"""
sim package initializer.

Purpose
-------
Marks the `sim` directory as a Python package and enables package-style imports
(e.g. `from sim.nodes import DERNode`). Currently intentionally empty; kept for
clarity and to allow `python -m sim.run_sim` style execution.

Notes
-----
- No runtime side effects.
- Keep minimal to avoid accidental module-level imports when importing `sim`.
